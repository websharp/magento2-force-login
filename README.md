# Force Frontend Customer Login Module for Magento2

The *Force Frontend Customer Login* Module for **Magento2** redirects a storefront visitor to the Magento2 Frontend login page, 
if the visitor is not logged in. It is possible to configure the whitelisted urls to add custom definitions.

## Use Case

Merchants provide some closed up products for only a specific group of users, e.g. enterprise related business partners and must assure only these partners can see the website or the product catalog.

## Features:

* Force your guest visitors to log in first (or register), before allowing them to visit your pages and catalog
* Administration: Manage the whitelist rules by the GUI in the administration area
* ACL: Restrict the administration of whitelist rules to certain backend user groups
* Whitelisting: Define url rules as pattern to define which pages guest visitors can visit without logging in first
* Multistore-Support: Define if whitelist rules either apply globally or for specific stores

### Overview Grid

You can add new entries by clicking on the *Add Entry* button in the upper right corner ( **1** ), [see below](#detail-form). 
The grid ( **2** ) contains all existing whitelisted *Url Rules*, for which the forced redirect to the *Customer Login Page* is omitted.
The *Url Rules* ( **3** ) are part of a regular expression checking on the called *Url* and tries to match against the whitelist.
*Url Rules* may be related to all stores or to a specific one ( **4** ). All rules except some mandatory ones are editable ( **5** ) and removeable ( **6** ).
